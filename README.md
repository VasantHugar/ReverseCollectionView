# ReverseCollectionView
By default UICollectionView has vertical layout where cells populate from Top-Left. How do we make it populate data from bottom-right instead.

## How to install?
1. Clone the Project using Commmad line or XCode or Anyother other tool.
2. You need to install Pod frameworks.
   - Open terminal and change directory to root folder of project. ``` $ cd <REPOSITORY-NAME> ```
   
   - Run ``` $ pod install ```
   - Once installing Pods successfully, Go to root folder and Open **ReverseCollectionView.xcworkspace** file insted of **ReverseCollectionView.xcodeproj**
